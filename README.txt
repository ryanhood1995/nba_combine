This project is a series of Jupyter Notebooks where I investigate NBA combine drills on draft selection
and overall NBA performance.  This project was meant for me to practice using Jupyter Notebooks, pandas,
Sci-kit Learn, Machine Learning methods, and data cleaning.

I will continue to add notebooks here as I complete them, delving further into the topic.

I want to thank Andrew Chou on data.world for the data set.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at ryanchristopherhood@gmail.com.
